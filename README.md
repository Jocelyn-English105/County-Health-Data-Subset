# County-Health-Data-Subset
## What is it?
This repository contains the materials that helped create the data subset. It uses the 
[County Health Data 2014-2015](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/11001/files/1951171?wrap=1) which comprises of various health factors, locations, and
other related information. More specifically the County Health Data was used to observe 
the prevalence of diabetes in 10 counties from the state of North Carolina and different 
regions in the United States. The intructions for the basics of Python 3 were provided by 
the [Research Hub](https://library.unc.edu/hub/) at UNC-Chapel Hill.

## Some of the items that can be found are listed below:
1. County Health Data 2014-2015
2. Instructions for using the basics of [Python3](https://github.com/Jocelyn-English105/County-Health-Data-Subset/blob/main/Python%20Basics%20(1).ipynb)
3. Instructions for using the [Pandas package](https://github.com/Jocelyn-English105/County-Health-Data-Subset/tree/main/Pandas%20Package)
4. The notebook that contains the [subset](https://github.com/Jocelyn-English105/County-Health-Data-Subset/tree/main/Subset%20Notebook) data procedure.

## Uses
The notebook contains the process used to take primary data of diabetes and turn it into something that 
can be easily analyzed. The instructions and process in the notebook are beginner friendly. Anyone who
would want to analyze specific health data by region or state may find this useful to create their own 
data subset. The subsets would be useful to explain health issues or disparities in the United States
for research purposes.

The [data image](https://github.com/Jocelyn-English105/County-Health-Data-Subset/tree/main/Data%20Images) folder contains an example of a graph that was generated using the data.
