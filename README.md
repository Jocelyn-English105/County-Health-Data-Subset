# County-Health-Data-Subset
## What is it?
This repository contains the materials that helped create the data subset. It uses the 
[County Health Data 2014-2015](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/11001/files/1951171?wrap=1) which comprises of various health factors, locations, and
other related information. More specifically the County Health Data was used to observe 
the prevalence of diabetes in 10 counties from the state of North Carolina and different 
regions in the United States. 

## Some of the items that can be found are listed below:
1. County Health Data [2014-2015](https://github.com/Jocelyn-English105/County-Health-Data-Subset/blob/main/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) (The original data file)
2. The notebook that contains the [subset](https://github.com/Jocelyn-English105/County-Health-Data-Subset/tree/main/Subset%20Notebook) data procedure. (.ipynb File) 
3. The [rawdata](https://github.com/Jocelyn-English105/County-Health-Data-Subset/blob/main/Subset%20Notebook/rawdata.csv) file created from the data procedure (.csv File).
4. A [visual](https://github.com/Jocelyn-English105/County-Health-Data-Subset/blob/main/Diabetes%20by%20Region%20(3).jpeg) of the data gathered from the subset created (.jpeg File)

## Uses
The notebook contains the process used to take primary data of diabetes and turn it into something that 
can be easily analyzed. The instructions and process in the notebook are beginner friendly. Anyone who
would want to analyze specific health data by region or state may find this useful to create their own 
data subset. The subsets would be useful to explain health issues or disparities in the United States
for research purposes.
 
## Data Image
The following image contains the data derived from the files. This is an example of how computational methods can be used to extract data 
and then be used to create visualizations.

 The graph includes the data from a random sample of regions and the prevalence of diabetes. Similar graphs can be made using external websites such as [Data Wrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de) and [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/).
