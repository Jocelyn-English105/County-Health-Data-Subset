# Pandas Package
This folder contains the instructions for the Pandas package. It is split into two different files. The files contain different sorts of commands that can be used with the Pandas Package. The 'Using Pandas Package 2' expands on the information from 'Pandas Package 1'. It's best to use both as reference guides.
